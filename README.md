# spacefaXcts
spacefaXcts is a web app that provides bite sized information to get you started on learning more about Space and it's entities.

### Description
spacefaXcts provides visitors a window into the infinite world of space

### Technologies
React
Bootstrap with react
Ajax (axios) for API fetching

### User Stories
User should be able to navigate the site with ease.
-able to go to each page on the navbar.
-acess mission photos and different rovers through the mars page.
-able to view astronomy photo of the day on #spotd page.

### Planning and Development Process
-I started with sketching out my ideas on paper, to help visualise the different pages my application would have.
-Afterwhich I started on the layouts of the individual pages by making individual components for them.
-Pages that require data fetches could then be implements after the layout is done.
-after fetching data for all pages that require them I can start on css and putting together the final look of the app.

### Problem-Solving Strategy
-try your best to solve them by your own means
-if that doesnt work employ google
-if that doesnt work, ask your friends
-if that still doesnt work, ask your instructors.


### Unsolved problems
-I had issues merging to my master branch after I deleted a large file in my master branch (the file prevented me from pushing as it was too large).
However that didnt solve the issue as git still thinks the file was in there, even though I deleted it through the GUI (on hindsight I should have deleted it through thet terminal". I actually wanted to add more animations to my applications but this took up all my time in the end.
